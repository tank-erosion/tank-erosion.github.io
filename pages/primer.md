### Before we begin...

Who is this for? There is no single solution that will solve the inheritance problem for everyone. Some people will prefer custodial solutions, some will rely on a trusted friend, some will a hybrid model or something else.  This guide seeks to detail best practices that will apply to the most people, but not necessarily the majority.  It is designed to evolve with new technology and expert consensus.  The author of this does not consider himself an expert, but seeks to leverage the public works of those who are. Some other guidelines:

1) Don't trust, verify. 

This guide will build upon existing writings leveraged to come to consensus and advise on an important aspect of holding Bitcoin. This will be a curation with editorial, where necessary. It is advisable to research other perspectives that may in agreement or disagreement with these recommendations.

2) Don't give your seed phrases/pins/passwords to anyone not part of your fellowship. 

Even a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/RonnieMoas/status/1048166109680218118?s=20">quick flash</a> of a seed phrase can allow for a bad actor to steal your funds at any point in the future. Only show this kind of information to people you want to assist with the future possession of your funds.

3) Only buy hardware wallets from the manufacturer's website 

There have been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ledger-hack-victim-scam-details">instances</a> receiving devices that have been tampered with. Only use devices you specifically order directly from the manufacturer (obviously not an option with DIY projects).

4) There are trade offs in this guide

Every trade off decision made in this guide seeks to optimize security, privacy, fragility, simplicity as it relates to inheritance. There is much more to privacy in Bitcoin day-to-day use that can be reviewed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy">here</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitcoiner.guide/privacy/">here</a>.
