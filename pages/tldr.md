### Too long, didn't read (tl;dr)

Create a 3-of-5 multisig wallet with at least three hardware devices from different manufacturers. You don't need to use a passphrase (25th word) with any seed but consider one fully airgapped hardware device. Stamp all 5 seed phrases into metal. Find 4-5 people you trust to give a hardware device or software signing key, a metal backup to the signing key, and all instructions. Retain two keys for yourself. Consider further redundancies and security layers with extreme caution.
