### Too long, didn't read (tl;dr)

Create a 3-of-5 multisig wallet with at least three hardware devices from different manufacturers. One AND ONLY ONE hardware device should have a passphrase (aka 13th or 25th seed word) and AT LEAST one should be fully airgapped (these can be the same). Stamp all 5 seed phrases, NOT INCLUDING PASSPHRASE, into metal and keep away from daily access and spread across multiple locations. Find 4-5 people you trust to give a hardware device or software signing key and all instructions. Retain two keys for yourself. Consider further redundancies and security layers with extreme caution.
