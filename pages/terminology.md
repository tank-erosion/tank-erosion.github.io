### Terminology

**Airgap**ing is the process of using a hardware device that interacts with another computer connected to the internet but does not rely on a physical cord.  Some would say the device is NEVER physically connected. Common methods for interfacing include via SD card transport and QR codes.  

**Fellowship** is what we will be calling your entire group of five signatories.

**Hardware devices** (aka hardware wallet, HWW, cold storage device) are probably better described as signers, but that might be confused with our use of "signatories" so we'll stick with hardware devices. 

**Multisig** is a colloquialism for multiple-signature. It means you have a single wallet derived from multiple seed phrases, with a minimum number of signatures required to send a transaction (see quorum and fellowship)

**Quorum** is minimum number of signatories required to sign/send a Bitcoin (three in the recommended setup).

A **signatory** is a person with the power to sign a Bitcoin transaction in a multisig setup.

A **signing key** is derived from a seed phrase or seed phrase with a passphrase and is used to sign a Bitcoin transaction. It can be included in the wallet file as a software key, or a hardware device.

A **wallet** for our purposes is a software file that contains all of the information needed to generate Bitcoin addresses, set up transactions for signing, and check balances. A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/giacomozucco/status/1429394680123428864?s=20">better term</a> for it is probably "keychain" or "portal" as it has more of a function of *accessing* than *possessing* funds. Bitcoin the token exists within the network ledger on the blockchain (or timechain), not in a wallet file or hardware device. When <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cold-storage.asp">normies</a> say things like "Cold storage is a way of holding cryptocurrency tokens offline," it is more accurate to say that *ACCESS TO MOVING* tokens are stored offline.
